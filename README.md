# EasyTrainer (Cyberpunk 2077)

**Created by Avi**  
A lightweight, GTA-style trainer for Cyberpunk 2077 built in Lua using Cyber Engine Tweaks (CET).  
This is my first Lua project and a personal tool I made to enhance my own playthroughs.

## What It Does

EasyTrainer gives you access to a bunch of simple in-game tools via an in-game menu:

- Change time, weather, and wanted level
- Edit weapons, attributes, and perk trees
- Teleport to known locations
- Toggle gameplay systems (e.g., gravity gun, cooldowns)
- Works with **keyboard** and **controller**
- Inspired by GTA trainers and SimpleMenu (Dank Rafft, capncoolio2)

## Controls

**Keyboard:**
- Arrow Keys = Navigate  
- Enter = Confirm  
- Backspace = Back

**Controller:**
- D-Pad = Navigate  
- A = Confirm  
- B = Back  
- Open Shortcut = **D-Pad Right + A**

**Overlay:**
- F4 to toggle menu (can be rebound in CET)  
- Drag window / resize from edges

## üß† Menu Tips

- **Integer / Float Inputs:** Use ‚Üê ‚Üí keys to adjust values
- **Toggles:** Press Enter / A to enable/disable
- **Dropdowns:** Enter to expand, ‚Üê ‚Üí to cycle
- **RGBA Buttons:** Adjust each channel with ‚Üê ‚Üí

## Known Limitations (for now)

Still a work-in-progress. Some stuff I want to add down the line:

- ‚ùå No language localization support yet
- ‚ùå No config saving ‚Äî options reset on reload
- ‚ùå No search/filter system in menus

I‚Äôll keep chipping away at it over time.

## Note
This isn‚Äôt meant to be a "perfect" trainer. It‚Äôs a passion project that grew over time.  
If it makes your Cyberpunk sessions more fun: I think I did well! :)
