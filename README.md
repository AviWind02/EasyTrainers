# EasyTrainer (Cyberpunk 2077)

**Created by Avi**  
A lightweight, GTA-style trainer for Cyberpunk 2077 built in Lua using Cyber Engine Tweaks.  
This is my first Lua project and a personal tool I made to enhance my own playthroughs.

## Note
This isn‚Äôt meant to be a "perfect" trainer. It‚Äôs a passion project that grew over time.  
If it makes your Cyberpunk sessions more fun: I think I did well!  
If you want to help improve it, even better.

## What It Does

EasyTrainer gives you access to a bunch of simple in-game tools via an in-game menu:

- Change time, weather, and wanted level
- Edit weapons, attributes, and perk trees
- Teleport to known locations
- Toggle gameplay systems (e.g., gravity gun, cooldowns)
- Works with **keyboard** and **controller**
- Inspired by GTA trainers and SimpleMenu (Dank Rafft, capncoolio2)

##  Contributing

I‚Äôd love to see people fork this, clone it, mess with it, improve it - or even just peek at the code (if you can make sense of it, lol).

If you want to add your own views, logic, or visuals, go for it. Pull requests and ideas are welcome.
